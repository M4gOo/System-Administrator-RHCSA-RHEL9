if the host need to access the internet, it will need a gateway and DNS.
Host wants to access google, it will ask DNS resolver what is the IP addr for google, then
DNS gives the IP-google so the host can connect to the google. Now the host can talk to the gateway
like I want this data to reach to IP-google, then the gateway sends it out from our network
to another network until reach the destination

dynamically  settings are from a service like DHCP
manually we need to set up the IP

first look for the name of the network
ip link show      OR      ip l
output it will be sometime like
enp0s3:....

different network interface, with more info
ip addresses show    OR    ip a
enp0s3:....
inet IPv4

network cards that use wire start with letter E, wirelless with W 

IPv4 - 32bits
IPv6 - 128bits

routing table
ip route show     OR    ip r
ip addr via default gateway
the output it will something like
default via 192.168.1.1 dev enp0s3 ...
the default getway it will be what is show above

to see the DNS that the system is currently using
/etc/resolv.conf
the output it will something like
nameserver 192.168.1.1

nameserver it will be always a valid DNS resolver, it is normal see two or more listed here,
those are for backups

static DNS
sudo /etc/hosts


centOS it will configure waht is inside this file
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
inside the file you see the different network adapter, choose one and it will show
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
this means it is auto configured
for static change dhcp for none
 in RH distros a program called network manager is the default or managing anything.
 
 2 usefull tools network manager has

 nmtui - network manager text user interface
 usually is installed by default, if not use dnf package
 sudo nmtui
 it will show another window wher eyou can configure the network inteface
 configure the DNS, Gateway, IPv4 + subnet if you choose manually
 to apply the configuration reboot or
 sudo nmcli device reapply enps03
 
 
 
 Configure network services to start automatically at boot ==============================================================================
 
 if the network manager is not working it wont have ips, gateways and so on
 check the network manager, mus be enabled
 systemctl status NetworkManager.service
 
 to install
 dnf install NetworkManager
 
 
 another way to enable nmcli at boot is 
 nmcli connection show  (take note of the name connection)
 sudo nmcli connection modify <name=enp0s3> auto connect yes



Start, stop, and check the status of network services =======================================================================================
SS  - modern tool
Netstat


sudo ss -tunlp  
-l : listening means ready to accept an incoming connection
-t : tcp connections
-u : udp connections
-n: numeric values, we get port number
-p: processes is envolved, with p flag needs sudo priv

ss -ltun    without p it will show the service name instead of port number

the output will have some 
Netid  State    Recv-Q   Send-Q     Local Address:Port      Peer Address:Port  Process                                                                        
udp    UNCONN   0        0          127.0.0.1:323             0.0.0.0:*      users:(("chronyd",pid=684,fd=13))                                     
udp    UNCONN   0        0                0.0.0.0:22            0.0.0.0:*      users:(("ssh",pid=1249,fd=7))                                                                              
udp    UNCONN   0        0                   [::]:53198             [::]:*      users:(("avahi-daemon",pid=921,fd=15))                                        
tcp    LISTEN   0        128                [::1]:631               [::]:*      users:(("cupsd",pid=1092,fd=6))    

127.0.0.1:323  - the program is listning for incoming connections from the system itself, but no from other computers
0.0.0.0:22  - it will accept connections from any external IP addr
[::]:53198 - this means same as 0.0.0.0, but listening for connections from IPv6
[::1]:631 - this means same as 127.0.0.1, but listening for connections from IPv6


in this table you can see the PID, with that we can check the pid and the files that are open by this process
ps  <pid>
sudo lsof -p <pid>



Implement packet filtering ===========================================================================================================

with a firewall added to the system will filter out what network packets are allowed to come into our system and even what network packets are 
allowed to go out

red hat has firewalld
the firewall manager puts every network interface in zones, each zones has own rules
zone drop is very restrictive and blocks all incoming connections
zone trusted - all connections are accepted, for example in a office you ccepted all those incoming connections

the default zone is public, every incoming connection is blocked, except  what we allow
check the zone 
firewall-cmd --get-default-zone

change the zone
firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=public

to see current firewall rules
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
 the output it will show the cockpit, where you can use a command to check the port are listening for the service cockpit
sudo firewall-cmd --info-service=cockpit 
 the output it will show the cockpit servie allow incoming connections to port example 9595 through a tcp protocol
 
to allow traffic can be both
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http   OR    sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp

then if you check the list, it will add a new rule in front of the cockpit
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

to remove
sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service=http    OR    sudo firewall-cmd --remove-port=80/tcp

instead to block all incoming traffic, can use different rule based on where the traffic is coming from
sudo firewall-cmd --add-source=10/11/12/0/24 --zone=trusted

check active zones
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones

remove filter based on ip addr
sudo firewall-cmd --remove-source=10.11.12.0/24 --zone=trusted

all the rules set above are no permanent if reboot the rules will be lost, to keep permanent does those commands below
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=123/tcp                                                                              add
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all                                                                                      check
sudo firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent       OR       sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=123/tcp --permanent          permanent


Statically route IP traffic ========================================================================================================


it is good to specify the IP of your won machine
sudo ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 via 10.11.12.100 dev enp0s3   dev-device name; enp0s3 is the name of interface
sudo ip route add default via 10.0.0.100    gateway, if you you want to rech at 1.2.3.8 routing table is consulted and if no specific route is found
then this data packet iis sent to the default route which is 10.0.0.100

to delete
sudo ip route del 192.168.0.0/24
sudo ip route del via 10.0.0.100

those routes added this way are temporary, to make permanent
nmcli connection show
nmcli connection modify <enp0s3> +ipv4.routes "192.168.0.0/24 10.0.0.100" 
this means if you want to reach to 192.168.0.0/24 route all traffic through the device 10.0.0.100
sudo nmcli device reapply <enp0s3>

to confirm
ip route show

to remove
home nmcli connection modify <enp0s3> -ipv4.routes "192.168.0.0/24 10.0.0.100"    use the - (minus)

you can use the tool 
sudo nmtui
sudo nmcli device reapply <enp0s3>


Configure time service clients ===============================================================================================================

keep the clock accurate
chrony daemon 

to see it is enable
systemctl status chronyd.service

run this command to check the system clock is synchronized
timedatectl

if is not enable by default first check if the time zone is set correctly
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York          to see all available zones timedatectl list-timezones
sudo dnf install chrony
sudo sysstemctl start chronyd.service
sudo sysstemctl enable chronyd.service
then checck the ntp is enable and system clock is synch using the command
timedatectl
in case is not enable
sudo systemctl set-ntp true
