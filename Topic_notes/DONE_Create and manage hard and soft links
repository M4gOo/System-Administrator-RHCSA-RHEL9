HARD LINKS ===================================================

stat /home/user/picture.jpg
it will show the inode. Inode remember all the pieces are store and keeps track like permissions, when modified, etc
links. usually you have one link which it will link the absolute path file to the inode

in case for example another user want to see the picture, you dont need copy and paste. This saves resource storage

ln path_to_target_file path_to_link_file
path_to_target_file - file you wnat to link
path_to_link_file - name of the new directory you wnat the pictures be copied

ln /home/user/Pictures/picture.jpg /home/new_user/Pictures/picture.jpg
ln /tmp/hlink /home/bob/hlink

if the user delete his file the new user still can have access to the pictures

limitations
  only for files, not directories
  only link on the same file system
  make sure has right permissions, the example abore we might add the user and new_user to the same group ( useradd -a -G family user ,  useradd -a -G family new_user)
  
  
  
 SOFT LINKS ===================================================
 
 soft link points to a path, like a shortcut
 
 ln -s /home/user/Pictures/picture.jpg /home/user/Desktop/pictures_shortcut.jpg
  ln -s /tmp /home/bob/link_to_tmp
 
 when you list ls -l it will showw the " L " at the beginning like:  lrwx------
 
 can use the command below to check the path link
 readlink pictures_shortcut.jpg
 
 if someone does change can break the link and it will be show in red when listed. to tackle that use relative paths to direct to the file and not the file itself, because if someone delete it wont work the link
 
 can soft link files, directories, can be in different file systems
