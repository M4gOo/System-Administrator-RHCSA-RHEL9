      backup entire disk or partition
      it will take a photo (imaging) for every bit
      before take this image you should unmount that disc or partition to make sure no data is being changed while you back it up
      sudo dd if=/dev/vda of=diskimage.raw bs=1M status=progress
      if= - it is the input file
      of= - specify the name or path you would like to use for the output, wher you want to store that image
      BS - block size (M -megabyte), this will speed up the process quite a bit
      status - tells the dd to show you the progress
      
      to restore just swap  if and of. Dont run this on your virtaul machine otherwise it will overwrite your disc
      sudo dd if=diskimage.raw of=/dev/vda bs=1M status=progress
