Boot, reboot, and shutdown a system safely===================================================


systemctl - system control

sudo systemctl reboot
sudo systemctl poweroff

sudo systemctl reboot --force
sudo systemctl poweroff --force

to "press" reset button
sudo systemctl reboot --force --force

"unplug" the system
sudo systemctl poweroff --force --force

to schedule a time to reboot or/and shutdown
sudo shutdown 02:00   (2am)
sudo shutdown +15     in 15min shutdown
sudo shutdown -r 02:00    reboot -r
sudo shutdown -r +15      reboot in 15min
sudo shutdown -r +1 'Shceduled restart to do an offline-backup of our database'  -  single quotes, message to tell the user a message before reboot/shutdown


Boot or change system into different operating modes===================================================

to check our default boot
systemcl get-default
graphical.target

sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target  
sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target  (temporary gives a graphical prompt, after reboot back to the default you set to boot)
sudo systemctl isolate emergency.target   (for troubleshooting, read permissions, few system are loaded). You must have root password
sudo systemctl isolate rescue.target      (root permission, there will be more programs than emergency). You must have root password



Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system ===========================================================
When the PC is start, press down when you see the grub boot screen and chose one of the kernel and press E
at the bottom type rd.break. When boot it will be in the emergency mode
this command can help when you lost the root password on RHEL8
mount -o remount rw /sysroot
cd /sysroot
chroot /sysroot
passwd root
touch /.autorelabel -hidden file in the root dir
reboot
exit

on RHEL9
When the PC is start, press down when you see the grub boot screen and chose one of the kernel and press E
at the second line after r\o and before crashkernel
change r\o to r\w
ctrl + e - to go to end of line
init=/bin/bash
ctrl + x
passwd (after reboot, in the terminal as root)
touch /.autorelabel -hidden file in the root dir. this fix the SELinux config
exec /sbin/init


Install, configure and troubleshoot bootloaders==========================================================================

one of the programs that loads up when turn on the computer it is a bootloader, this is to start the linux kernel
popular bootloader on linux is the GRUB

problem with the bootloader so the OS wont boot at all. We can use an USB sticky and boot from there using troubleshooting
then select - Rescue a CentOS Stream system 
choose option 1
chroot /mnt/sysroot
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg   - generate a GRUB conf file when you have BIOS
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg   - generate a GRUB conf file when you have EFI
lsblk - need to set the grub at the beginning of the disk, first check the block device (check for sd or vd), look for /boot, /
grub2-install /dev/sda
dnf resinstall grub2-efi grub2-efi-modules shim (this is for EFI only)
exit


change GRUB conf
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg - this is only for EFI
sudo systemctl reboot


Diagnose and manage processes ================================================================================================
man ps   -then type /EXAMPLES

ps a is different than ps -a

ps will show programs laiched in our current terminal window or session

ps aux -display all process in the machine. 
        ax show all process
        u list processes in a user oriented format (can see useful column like CPU and memory)
        
top

ps <PID>

ps u <PID>    cpu and memory

ps -U <username>

ps u -U <username>

pgrep -a <process>


niceness value, between -19 to 19, more negative more resource will be available

nice -n 11 <process>    

regular user can only assign nice number between 0 to 19

ps l    will show the nice value in the column (NI)

to change the nice number when the process is up
sudo renice <nice_value> <PID>

to give signals to the programs

list of signals 
kill -L

sudo kill -SIGHUP <PID>


ctrl + Z -> background process. the process will be frozen
fg        -> bring back to foreground


to run in back ground use the &
sleep 300&

check commands in the bacckground  
jobs  
when you use the & and wants bring back use
jobs command to see the programs are running and also the number then
fg <select_the_number>

if the job is stopped with ctrl+z  use the jobs command to check the number and then use
bg <select_the_number>



what files or dir resources using right now
for example to see which files and dir bash process is currently using
lsof
ls - list
of- open files

lsof <PID>



Locate and analyze system log files ======================================================================================

log daemon rsyslog is the popular in Linux that stores all logs in /var/log

ls /var/log/

grep -r 'ssh' /var/log/

system logs
/var/log/messages
/var/log/

tail -F /var/log/secure   (you can watch the log waiting for inputs; liveview)

journalctl              ( > you can use to navigate)
journalctl /bin/sudo
journalctl -u sshd.service
journalctl -e    (go to end to the journalctl)
journalctl -F     (liveview)
journalctl -p err              (use journalctl -p to list those using 2 TAB -> (err, alert, crit, debug, emerge, info, notice, warning, ...))
journalctl -S 02:00   -S for specify time
journalctl -S 01:00 -U 02:00            logs starte in 01:00 to 02:00
journalctl -S  '2021-11-16 12:04:55'
journalctl logs are reset after reboot/power off, to save create /var/log/journal/


to see who is logged in the system
last     
lastlog  (ssh will see an IP addr)
