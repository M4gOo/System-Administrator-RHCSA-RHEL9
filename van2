/etc/NetworkManager/system-connection      #configuration is stored
sudo yum -y install NetworkManager
systemctl enable NetworkManager --now

good to use nmtui in the exam rather than nmcli
make sure to check automatically connect and available to all users
make sure to deactivated and active again
add the ip and hostname to /etc/hosts

rpm -qa show all packages currently installed
rpm -qf /bin/ls

better to use DNF

dnf repolist           #check the repo list available
dnf provides */mkfs.vfat
rpm -qp --scripts httpd-...        # search for packages /etc/yum.repos.d/AppStream/Packages
dnf search all seinfo
dnf updatte kernel - update the old kernel and keep the old kernel as a backup

Configuring rsyslogd
this is another loggin srvice on redhat
/etc/rsyslog.conf
systemctl enable rsyslogd


vim /etc/rsyslog.conf     #create an entry in rsyslog that writes all messages with severity of error 
*.err   /var/log/error

logger -p err hello     #to check cat /var/log/error

XFS is the default filesystem
fast and scalable
size can be increase, not decreased

EXT4 
size can be increased and decreased

VFAT offers multi-OS support
used for shared devices (like thumb drivers)

blkid - shows all devices with their naming attributes
mkfs.* -L    is used to set a label while creating fs
xfs_admin -L
tune2fs -L   (ext)

/etc/fstab    #this is for swap
/dev/sda1   none swap defaults 0 0               #can be swap, but nowadays use none
swapon -a
free -m

mount
for temporary use /mnt
findmnt
extended partition cannot be mounted, only logical partition inside the extended partition can be mounted

vgextend
lvextend -r -L +1G    if dont use the -r neet do use other commands like resize2fs (ext) and xfs_growfs (xfs)

reducing volume groups 
1- use pvmove     #pvmove -v /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdb1
2- vgreduce       #vgreduce volume_group_name /dev/sdb2


stratis - next generationb volume managin filesystem that uses thin provisioning by default 
implemented in user space, which makes API access possible. Important for container and cloud environment

stratis pool need a minimal 4G
stratisd stratis-cli
systemctl enable stratisd --now
in /etc/fstab defaults, x-systemd.requires=stratisd.service 0 0    #you dont need to add defaults

stratis fs snapshot mypool myfs myfs-snapshot
mkdir /mount/myfs-snapshot
mount dev/stratis/mypool/myfs-snap /mount/myfs-snapshot
